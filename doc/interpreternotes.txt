-Create the inital environment by binding the behaviours
-Instantiate the first actor
-Run step function with this actorinstance
-Step then evaluates a small chunk of code, and calls scheduler
-Scheduler picks out an actor from the list of actors
-Step is then run again
-Repeat untill execution finished 

(need to iron out implementation details, but that's a slightly more focused view of what will happen)

-In the tool, the scheduler will be the user

1. What should the message type contain? 
2. For the scheduler, I need some way of knowing which actors are ready to execute.
    -For this, I can use an event queue which will look at which actors have messages in their mailboxes
    -But what about pre-receive statements?
