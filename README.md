# drama-lang

This repository will house the code I am writing as part of my 3rd year project at the University of Southampton. 

Drama is an actor based language, implemented in Haskell; this repository will provide tools to write a program in this language, and execute it.
Execution can be done normally (i.e. all in one go), or it can be stepped through, allowing the state to be examined at each step.
